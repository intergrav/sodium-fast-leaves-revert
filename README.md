### Update: Jellysquid has stated that this will be fixed and so this resource pack is likely no longer needed. It will remain archived unless anything changes. See the CaffeineMC discord for more information.

**As of the time of writing this, Sodium 0.4.10 is not fully released yet. It is still in development and this decision could be changed at any time!**

Sodium 0.4.10 includes a change that causes all leaves to look, subjectively, quite bad (like 6-sided grass blocks!) when Fast leaves are used. This resource pack makes an attempt to undo the effects of this change, bringing vanilla parity to how fast leaves look. 

Please keep in mind though that this will break fancy leaves, as this pack achieves its goal by simply making all leaves opaque no matter what. You will have to turn off the resource pack when enabling fancy graphics.
