**Sodium 0.4.10 is not currently out and is still in development! This decision could possibly change, and if so, this resource pack will be removed.**

Sodium 0.4.10 includes a change that causes all leaves to look, subjectively, quite bad (like 6-sided grass blocks!) on Fast leaves graphics. This resource pack makes an attempt to undo the effects of this change, bringing vanilla parity to how fast leaves look. 

Please keep in mind though that this will break fancy leaves, as this pack simply makes all leaves opaque no matter what. You will have to turn off the resource pack when enabling fancy graphics.
